## TODO
- check/uncheck all for column select
- save most recent query fields in session?  (need reset btn)
- compact view option (ie one line with cutoffs, click to expand)
- search all fields for phrase
- quick search links (defined in config)
- Utilize GET for custom queries
- Config option to specify defining manual drop down list for any column.
- Date picker for db type date (solution not that great)
- Combine insert and edit code into one.
- Text cutoff and/or warning on varchar size
- Logging option for history.  Log to file?
- Simple security option?
- sort by number if col is numeric
- Display foreign key readable names in query results
